# Step 3

We have setup our actions, now we need to implement the `load` action to actually call the backend.

## Effects

The effects file is located [here](../libs/products/data-access/src/lib/+state/products.effects.ts) and contains some dummy default code we saw in action in last step.

Effects are side-effect code which are executed when an action is triggered (specified in the `ofType` operator).
They are created with the `createAction` function

> add a dependency to the `ProductsService`

> call the service in the load action and return a loadSuccess action with the fetched data

## Reducers

The reducers resides [here](../libs/products/data-access/src/lib/+state/products.effects.ts).

Reducers are function that do store mutations. Store mutation should only occure here and **nowhere else!**. Store mutation **MUST** be done in an immutable way: so we you want to modify an element you will have to make a deep copy of it with the modification.

The default loadSuccess reducer should already be implemented and will update the entities in the store.
We could also add a `loading` property in the state to be able to detect when we triggered load and when we got a response (success or failure).

> use the selector to get data in the list component instead of calling the findAll from the ProductsService

> remove the ProductsService injection

> update the tests
