# Step 2

Now that our feature store is ready we will add action for our application. We need actions for:
- loading products
- edit a product
- create a product
- remove a product

## Actions

The actions file is located [here](../libs/products/data-access/src/lib/+state/products.actions.ts) and contains some default actions.

To create an action we call the `createAction` function from the `@ngrx/store` package and pass it a **unique identifier** and eventually some parameters definition.

In the generated code we've got 3 actions:
- initProducts
- loadProductsSuccess
- loadProductsFailure


### Note
The `createAction` function is the *old way* of creating action, but there is a new `createActionGroup` which avoid some boilerplate code by removing the repetition of the group (here: `[Products]`) in the name of the action.

Here is a replacement of the default code :
```typescript
import { createActionGroup, emptyProps, props } from '@ngrx/store';
import { ProductsEntity } from './products.models';

export const ProductsActions = createActionGroup({
  source: 'Products',
  events: {
    'init': emptyProps(),
    'load products success': props<{ products: ProductsEntity[] }>(),
    'load products failure': props<{ error: any }>()
  }
});
```

> Rename the `init` action to `Load` (don't forget to rename the method in the facade)
> Rename the `load products success` to `Load Success`
> Rename the `load products failure` to `Load Failure`

## Component

Now that we got a load action we should dispatch it in the best place. For this example there is 2 good places:
- in an ngOnInit of the [ListComponent](../libs/products/ui/src/lib/components/list/list.component.ts)
- in a route guard before accessing the [product routes](../apps/frontend/src/app/app.routes.ts)

For simplicity's sake we are going to do it the `ListComponent`.

> Add an injection of the `ProductsFacade` in the `ListComponent`

> In the ngOnInit hook, call the `load` function from the facade

## Explanations

Now if you check in the devtools you should see that `[Products] Load` action is getting triggered (and also `[Products] Load Success`). It's because when we generated the feature store we got a default effect class to handle the load action.

# End
In the [next step](./2.MD) we will change the default behaviour of the load action.
